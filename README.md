# BLE-HeartRate-Monitor
A messy and hacky script to monitor heart rate using a BLE chest strap in python. This project is meant to serve as an educational experience and a proof of concept for the development of a future mobile app.

The key functionalities include:

1. **Connect to a BLE Heart Rate Monitor**: Establish a connection with a specified BLE heart rate monitor device.
2. **Real-Time Heart Rate Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the heart rate data from the device.
3. **Feedback Based on Target Heart Rate Zone**: Provide feedback to the user to stay within a specified target heart rate zone.
4. **HIIT mode**: Provide the user with the ability to setup a HIIT workout with a dynamic target heart rate zone. 
4. **Logging Heart Rate Data**: Optionally log the heart rate data for post-workout analysis.
