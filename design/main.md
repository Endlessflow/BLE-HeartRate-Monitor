# Main

#### Responsibilities and Functionalities:

The main script is responsible for tying together the different components of the application and initiating the application flow. It acts as the orchestrator for starting up and managing the lifecycle of the application.

1. **Initialize the Application**:
   - Load the configuration settings from a file.
   - Create instances of the `HeartRateMonitor` and `BLEDeviceManager` with the loaded settings.

2. **Set Up the GUI**:
   - Initialize the GUI with references to the `HeartRateMonitor`.
   - Register the GUI as an observer to the `HeartRateMonitor` for updates.

3. **Manage Application Flow**:
   - Handle the starting and stopping of heart rate monitoring through GUI actions.
   - Ensure graceful shutdown of the application, including disconnecting from BLE devices and closing the GUI.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement global error handling to catch and log unhandled exceptions.
   - Ensure the application exits gracefully in case of errors.

### Preliminary Design:

#### Main Script Structure:

- Functions to load configuration and initialize modules.
- Creation and display of the GUI window.
- Connection of the GUI with the `HeartRateMonitor`.
- Main event loop to keep the application running.

#### Key Functions:

- `load_configuration()`: Loads configuration data from a file.
- `initialize_modules()`: Sets up the necessary instances of modules.
- `create_gui()`: Initializes and configures the GUI component.
- `start_application()`: Starts the application, including the main event loop.
- `shutdown_application()`: Handles any cleanup necessary to shut down the application.

### Implementation Considerations:

- **Robust Configuration Loading**: Ensure that the application can handle missing or malformed configuration data without crashing.

- **Module Initialization**: Properly handle any issues that arise during the initialization of the `HeartRateMonitor` and `BLEDeviceManager`.

- **Global Exception Handling**: Wrap the entry point in a try-except block to catch any unexpected exceptions and log them.

- **Clean Exit Strategy**: Make sure that hitting the close button or an exit command from the GUI triggers a clean shutdown process.
