# BLEDeviceManager

### Responsibilities and Functionalities

The `BLEDeviceManager` module is responsible for handling all Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) related operations. Here are its main responsibilities:

1. **Device Discovery**: Scan for available BLE devices and identify the specified heart rate monitor based on its MAC address or name.

2. **Establishing Connection**: Connect to the heart rate monitor securely and maintain the connection. This includes handling any reconnection logic if the connection is lost.

3. **Managing BLE Services and Characteristics**: Discover and interact with the necessary BLE services and characteristics of the heart rate monitor, specifically those related to heart rate data.

4. **Data Retrieval**: Facilitate the retrieval of heart rate data from the device. This does not involve processing the data but ensuring that it is accessible to other components of the application.

5. **Handling Disconnection**: Gracefully handle disconnection requests from the user or due to external factors (like going out of range).

6. **Error Handling and Status Reporting**: Robustly handle errors related to BLE operations and report the status of the connection and any errors to the higher-level components for appropriate user feedback.


### Preliminary Design

The class should encapsulate all the necessary functionalities for managing a BLE device.

#### Attributes:
- `address`: The MAC address of the BLE device.
- `client`: An instance of `BleakClient` or similar, for managing the BLE connection.
- `connected`: A boolean to track the connection status.
- `services`: To store information about discovered services and characteristics.

#### Methods:
- `__init__(self, address)`: Constructor to initialize the class with the device's MAC address.
- `connect(self)`: To establish a connection with the device. It should attempt to establish a BLE connection using the provided address.
- `disconnect(self)`: To disconnect from the device. It should properly close the connection.
- `scan_and_connect(self)`: To scan for devices and connect to the specified device. It might involve scanning for available devices and then attempting to connect to the specified device.
- `get_heart_rate_service(self)`: To discover and return the heart rate service. It should discover available services on the device and identify the one related to heart rate monitoring.
- `handle_disconnection(self)`: To handle unexpected disconnections. It should include logic to attempt reconnection or notify the user of the disconnection.
- `is_connected(self)`: To check the connection status. It should returns the current connection status.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Asynchronous Operations**: BLE operations should be handled asynchronously to not block the main application thread, especially during scanning and data retrieval.

- **State Management**: The module should keep track of the connection state (connected, disconnected, scanning, etc.).

- **Modularity**: Design the module so that it can be easily used by other components of the application without them needing to know the intricacies of BLE operations.

- **Testing and Extensibility**: The module should be designed for easy testing (possibly using mock objects for BLE devices) and be extensible for future enhancements or support for additional BLE devices.
